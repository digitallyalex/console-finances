# Console Finances Analyser

## Deployed Website Link
https://digitallyalex.github.io/console-finances/

## Description
This project was created to analyse the financial records of a company using JavaScript, and showcase them in the Console Log.

This was a challenging, yet rewarding exercise that further strengthened my initial knowledge of JavaScript variables, for loops and arrays, in combination with mathematical problems.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
This web application provides an analysis of the financial data for a private company.

By opening the Console Log, users can see:
- The total number of months analysed,
- The average month-to-month change in revenue,
- The month with the greatest increase in revenue, together with the change amount, and
- The month with the greatest decrease in revenue, together with the change amount.

If you encounter any errors or issues with this application, please let me know.

## Credits
Overall instruction and provision of necessary materials for this project from the EdX Front-End Web Development Bootcamp instructor and teaching assistants (Oct2023 Cohort).

Additionally, a few resources and tutorials were very helpful in guiding me towards the completion of this task and learning JavaScript over the past week overall:

- On JS Variables: https://javascript.info/variables
- On JS Conditional Branching: https://javascript.info/ifelse
- On JS Loops: https://javascript.info/while-for
- On Calculating array sums: https://www.educative.io/answers/how-to-get-the-sum-of-an-array-in-javascript
- ChatGPT, for clear, broken-down explanations on the concepts of for loops and arrays: https://chat.openai.com/
